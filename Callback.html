<!--
	What is callback?
			In genral english: call it after sometime.
			
			* A function which is passed as parameter into another function and get executed after certain condition is called callback function.
			  The outer function may process some value and give it as input for this callback function.
			
	Why we need to use callback function ?

			* Javascript is a event driven language which means it will keep running to next line while listening to an event, so functions 
			  may not return values in a order in which they get called  .But we may wants to Ensure the order of execution. 
			  At this point we can go for Callback.

	When can I use callback function ?

			* I want to call function 'B' after the execution of function 'A' . But I don't know when function A's execution will gets complete.
			  At this point I can send function 'B' as a parameter to function A. So here we are ensuring B is called after A.
	
	When need not to use callback function ?
			
			* when we dont have a need to do asynchronus operations.
	
	Advantages ? 

			* Enables javascript to work asynchronusly even it is a single threaded language.

	Disadvantages ?

			* Poor readblity of the code.
