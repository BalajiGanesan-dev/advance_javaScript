    What is Iterators?
                    Iterators is an object which defines a sequence and potentially returns a value on he completion.

                    Iterable Protocol : Some built-in objects like Array are having iteration behavior by default . But 
                                        genral objects do not have. So Iterable protocols allows to define the iteration behavior 
                                        in genral Objects.
